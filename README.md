# Narrative Intelligence Engine

**A Constitutionally-Bound Structural Proof System**

> *To distinguish 'Narrative' from 'Noise' not by inference, but by structural falsification.*

## 🚨 Constitutional Status: LOCKED

This system is no longer an exploratory prototype. It is a **verified instrument** operating under a strict "Falsifier Constitution".

**The Core Theorem:**
> *Narrative emergence is neither semantic nor temporal; it is a function of explicit edge density under trusted constraints.*

> *Note: The absence of a narrative is a result, not a failure.*

The engine does not "discover" stories. It **rejects** any set of data that fails to meet minimum structural connectivity requirements. It prioritizes **Type I Error Avoidance** (refusing to ratify a false narrative) above all else.

## 📂 Validation Artifacts (The "Proof of Work")

The system's behavior has been characterized via rigorous stress-testing.

1.  [**Taxonomy Report**](file:///c:/Users/ROG Strix/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe0c3552-1cfa-4b2b-88c7-d5d9b18848d8/taxonomy_report.md)
    *   *Finding*: The "Binary Stability" of narrative graphs.
    *   *Result*: Narratives do not degrade gracefully; they collapse instantly if edge density falls below $N-1$.

2.  [**Fragility Report**](et_hackathon_project/demo_artifacts/fragility_report.md)
    *   *Finding*: The "Glass Bridge" Phenomenon.
    *   *Result*: Visualization of the "Load-Bearing" nature of every single edge in a sequential narrative.

3.  [**Walkthrough**](file:///c:/Users/ROG Strix/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe0c3552-1cfa-4b2b-88c7-d5d9b18848d8/walkthrough.md)
    *   *Finding*: The success of "Edge Injection".
    *   *Result*: How explicit trust signals (e.g., specific sequential links) override forensic suspicion.

## 🛠 System Modes

The engine operates in two discrete modes, enforced by the `StateMachine`:

| Mode | Behavior | Epistemic Stance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strict Mode** (Default) | Rejects all inferred connections. Returns "Cloud" (disconnected points) unless edges are explicit. | *Refusal to Hallucinate* |
| **Trusted Mode** | Accepts explicit provenance edges (Hyperlinks, Analyst Sequence). Verifies connectivity. | *verification of Supplied Structure* |

**Forbidden Actions (Constitutionally Banned):**
*   ❌ Semantic Edge Inference (Embedding-based connection)
*   ❌ Narrative Auto-Completion / Repair
*   ❌ "Likelihood" Scoring
*   ❌ Hidden Smoothing of Gaps

## 🚀 Running the Instrument

### 1. The Full Pipeline (Edge Injection Experiment) - Phase 4 Runner
Run the experiment battery that characterizes the failure envelopes.
```bash
python demo/run_phase4_experiments.py
```

### 2. The Visualization (Glass Bridge) - Phase 5 Runner
Generate the structural fragility diagrams.
```bash
python demo/run_fault_visualization.py
```
*Output: `demo_artifacts/fragility_report.md`*

## 🏗 Architecture (The "Verifier" Pattern)

*   **Ingestion**: Raw, immutable feed capture.
*   **Normalization**: Extraction of "Evidence Fragments".
*   **Edge Admission Gate**: **The Critical Gatekeeper.** Only verifiable edges enter here.
*   **Core Engine**: Deterministic State Machine. Replays events. Fails if structure is broken.
*   **Topology Visualizer**: Pure analytical layer. Renders the graph without "fixing" it.

## Conclusion

This project is a rejection of "Generative Narrative". It is a **Narrative Detector**.

It proves that for forensic purposes, a "story" is not a soft concept; it is a hard structural property that can be mathematically verified—or falsified.
