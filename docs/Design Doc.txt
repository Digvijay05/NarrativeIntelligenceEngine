UX / Interaction Design Document
Product: Narrative Intelligence Engine

1. Design Principles
Epistemic goals
* Clarity over certainty: The interface privileges traceable structure and temporal coherence, not definitive conclusions.
* Continuity over immediacy: Understanding emerges across time spans, not single moments.
* Comparability over persuasion: Users are enabled to contrast narratives without being nudged toward an interpretation.
* Absence as signal: Silence, delay, and disappearance are treated as first-class informational states.
Explicit anti-goals
* The interface must never imply truth adjudication, intent attribution, or moral judgment.
* The interface must never suggest predictive power or foresight.
* The interface must never collapse multiple narratives into a single "master story."
* The interface must never reward speed, virality, or popularity cues.

2. Primary User Flows
Flow A: Investigating a Hidden Progression
Entry point: The user arrives at a neutral landing surface presenting recent narrative landscapes, not headlines.
Exploration: The user selects a visible high-attention event window and expands its temporal boundary. Parallel narrative bands appear beneath the dominant one.
Sense-making: The user notices a low-visibility narrative steadily advancing during the same window. They trace its continuity across weeks.
Exit: The user bookmarks the reconstructed narrative arc and exports a reference view for later inspection.
Flow B: Understanding Narrative Collapse
Entry point: The user enters via a topic search framed as "What changed over time?"
Exploration: The system presents a longitudinal timeline with visible intensity decay.
Sense-making: The user inspects the moment where discourse drops without resolution markers. The interface highlights unresolved states rather than conclusions.
Exit: The user records an analytic note acknowledging ambiguity and exits without forced synthesis.

3. Core Screens / States
A. Narrative Landscape Overview
Purpose: Establish the field of competing narratives.
Primary question: "What stories are coexisting right now?"
Do not show: Judgments, summaries, or causal explanations.
B. Timeline Deep Dive
Purpose: Reveal progression, acceleration, stalling, or disappearance.
Primary question: "How did this narrative behave over time?"
Do not show: Sentiment labels, rankings, or predictions.
C. Parallel Narrative Comparison
Purpose: Enable side-by-side temporal reasoning.
Primary question: "What advanced while attention was elsewhere?"
Do not show: Aggregated scores or dominant-story emphasis.
D. Evidence Trace View
Purpose: Allow inspection of why structure appears as shown.
Primary question: "What supports this shape?"
Do not show: Hidden inference steps or opaque summaries.

4. Narrative Visualization Mechanics
* Timelines: Elastic rather than fixed, stretching to emphasize quiet continuity as much as peaks.
* Parallel narratives: Rendered as adjacent bands with independent lifecycles, not stacked hierarchies.
* Attention shifts: Visualized as divergence between narrative momentum and discourse intensity.
* Silence / absence: Represented as faded continuity lines with explicit markers indicating unresolved states, not blank space.

5. Edge Cases & Failure States
* Incomplete data: The interface surfaces gaps as shaded uncertainty zones, never smoothing them away.
* Conflicting sources: Divergence is displayed spatially, allowing coexistence without forced reconciliation.
* Sudden narrative collapse: Marked as "cessation without closure," distinct from resolution.
* Overlapping events with unclear causality: Shown as intersecting timelines without arrows or causal claims.

6. Trust & Explainability Affordances
* Users can expand any narrative segment to see why it exists, when it formed, and what sustained it.
* Structural reversibility is emphasized: timelines can be rewound, narrowed, or expanded without penalty.
* Auditability is conveyed through consistent, repeatable narrative shapes when revisited.

7. Accessibility & Cognitive Ergonomics
* Reading load: Short declarative labels replace paragraphs; prose is optional, never mandatory.
* Visual density: Information layers are progressive, revealed only on interaction.
* Progressive disclosure rules: No screen reveals more than one analytic dimension at a time (time, comparison, or traceability).

8. Open Design Questions
* How much ambiguity users tolerate before seeking external confirmation.
* Whether different personas require distinct default temporal scales.
* How to visually encode long-term narrative persistence without implying importance.
* When silence should prompt user attention versus remain unobtrusive.
