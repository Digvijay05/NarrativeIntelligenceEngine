Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name (Working): Narrative Intelligence Engine

1. Context / Problem Statement
Modern public discourse operates less like a library and more like a crowded bazaar: information is abundant, loud, and constantly rearranged. Events unfold across digital media in fragments-headlines, statements, counter-statements-rarely forming a coherent storyline. As a result, critical developments often progress quietly while public attention is absorbed elsewhere.
Who is affected
* Journalists attempting to reconstruct what actually happened, not just what was said.
* Researchers and policy analysts tracking long-term implications of public actions.
* Informed citizens trying to understand issues beyond daily news cycles.
Why existing solutions fail structurally
Current tools optimize for volume, speed, or engagement. They treat information as isolated items rather than as parts of evolving narratives. This structural bias favors immediacy over continuity, reaction over causality, and popularity over relevance. As a consequence, users are left to manually assemble timelines, identify missing links, and infer which developments mattered but escaped attention.

2. Goals & Non-Goals
Goals
* Enable users to reconstruct coherent narratives from fragmented public information.
* Surface progression, stalling, or disappearance of narratives over time.
* Reduce cognitive effort required to understand complex, multi-actor situations.
* Support informed decision-making grounded in context rather than isolated facts.
Non-Goals
* The product will not judge intent, truth, or moral correctness of actors.
* The product will not predict future events or outcomes.
* The product will not replace investigative or editorial judgment.
* The product will not act as a real-time breaking news system.

3. Users / Personas
Persona 1: Journalist
* Role: Investigative or beat reporter
* Core pain: Stories evolve across weeks, but coverage resets daily.
* Decision they struggle with: Which developments are genuinely new versus recycled noise?
Persona 2: Researcher
* Role: Academic or independent analyst
* Core pain: Primary sources are scattered and temporally misaligned.
* Decision they struggle with: How to establish a reliable sequence of events.
Persona 3: Policy Analyst
* Role: Think-tank or governance professional
* Core pain: Policy shifts often occur during attention-diversion windows.
* Decision they struggle with: Whether a policy progressed quietly or was openly debated.
Persona 4: Informed Citizen
* Role: Civically engaged individual
* Core pain: Headlines explain moments, not movements.
* Decision they struggle with: What actually changed beneath the news cycle.

4. Use Cases / User Stories
* When public attention is concentrated on a high-visibility event, the user needs to identify other significant developments occurring in parallel so that hidden progressions are not missed.
* When multiple actors make conflicting claims over time, the user needs to see how those claims evolved so that shifts and reversals are clear.
* When an issue spans months or years, the user needs to understand its narrative arc so that isolated updates are placed in context.
* When discourse intensity suddenly drops, the user needs to assess what stalled or concluded so that silence is not mistaken for resolution.
* When preparing analysis or reporting, the user needs to verify continuity across sources so that conclusions rest on structure, not anecdotes.

5. Functional Requirements
* The system must be able to assemble events into coherent, time-ordered narratives.
* The system must allow users to observe how narratives emerge, peak, fragment, or disappear.
* The system must distinguish between claims, counter-claims, and supporting context.
* The system must prevent single-source dominance from defining an entire narrative.
* The system must enable comparison between parallel narratives competing for attention.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
* Accuracy / Trustworthiness: Outputs must be traceable to observable public information and avoid speculative leaps.
* Latency Tolerance: Users should expect reflective analysis rather than instantaneous reactions.
* Reliability: Narrative reconstructions should remain consistent when revisited.
* Explainability: Users must be able to understand why a narrative is structured as shown.
* Ethical Constraints: The system must avoid amplifying harmful misinformation or targeting individuals.

7. Constraints
* Legal / Regulatory: Must respect content usage rights and jurisdictional norms.
* Data Availability: Operates under incomplete, delayed, and biased public information.
* Operational Boundaries: Designed for analysis, not enforcement or surveillance.
* Ethical Red Lines: No profiling, persuasion, or behavioral manipulation.

8. Success Metrics (KPIs)
* Reduction in time required to understand a complex issue end-to-end.
* Consistency of narrative reconstruction across repeated analyses.
* User-reported confidence in contextual understanding.
* Adoption and repeated use by target personas for real analytical tasks.

9. Risks & Assumptions
Assumptions
* Users value context over speed.
* Narrative coherence improves decision quality.
Risks
* Misinterpretation of narratives as definitive truth.
* Overreliance on the system without critical judgment.
* External shifts in media ecosystems affecting information availability.
External Dependencies
* Stability of public discourse channels.
* Willingness of users to engage with longitudinal analysis.
