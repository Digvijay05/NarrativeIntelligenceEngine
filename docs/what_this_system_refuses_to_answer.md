# What This System Refuses to Answer
**Epistemic Boundaries of the Narrative Instrument**

This system is an **oscilloscope**, not an oracle.
It measures signal intensity, topology, and absence.
It does **NOT** measure truth, intent, or meaning.

To maintain forensic integrity, this system explicitly **REFUSES** to answer the following questions:

---

## 1. "What Really Happened?"
**Refusal:** The system does not access ground truth. It accesses **reports** of truth.
- It can visualize: "Source A reported X at Time T."
- It cannot state: "X happened."

## 2. "Who Is Right?"
**Refusal:** Adjudication is outside the system's physics.
- If Source A says "Sky is Blue" and Source B says "Sky is Red", the system renders **Divergence**.
- It will never collapse the wavefunction to "Blue".
- Resolution is the responsibility of the human analyst, not the instrument.

## 3. "Is This Disinformation?"
**Refusal:** "Disinformation" implies intent. The system sees only **structure**.
- It can detect: "Coordination of timing" or "Repetition of tokens".
- It cannot detect: "Malicious intent".
- We measure the *shape* of the lie, not the lie itself.

## 4. "What Is The Summary?"
**Refusal:** Summarization is lossy compression.
- The system preserves **Evidence Fragments** verbatim.
- It refuses to synthesize a "TL;DR" because generative summarization hallucinates and erases nuance (e.g., the specific vocabulary used by a specific actor).

## 5. "Why Did This Stop?"
**Refusal:** Causality is inferred, not observed.
- The system observes **Absence** (expected continuation failed to arrive).
- It does not know *why* (Censorship? Internet outage? loss of interest?).
- It renders the Gap; it does not explain it.

## The "Zero-Shot" Promise
This system operates **Zero-Shot** on narrative causality.
It has no training data about "how stories usually go."
It treats every timeline as a novel mechanical event.

**By refusing to guess, we preserve the ability to prove.**
